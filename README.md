hai
to use this amorphous thing i creat
just fork it, clone it,download it manually idk
u need some environmental (.env) things (google if u dont know whats that)
"Discord" that needs to have your Discord bot's token
"Gemini" that will have your gemini api key (https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
"Id" you can put your bot's id there (it will basically be a prefix. u can find the id in the general info of your bot. it basically looks like numbers. to make the bot's "@" be prefix just type "<@id number>" in the .env file)
"Rp" you put there the prompt (a prompt is smth that has personality,backstory etc. Basically everything the ai needs to know I'd recommend saying there to make the responses X-Y tokens long cuz someone can waste ur api
"Name" do i seriously need to explain this XD (name of the bot if u dont get what should be there)
"User" just put ur user id here. still fixing this but it will basically let u bypass the command restrictions (basically let you use any commands the bot has (activate,wack,deactivate,allow etc) if u dont have admin)
also run pip install -r requirements.txt or u will get big scary ModuleNotFoundError
